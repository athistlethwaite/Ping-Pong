# Pong Game

This project is a basic pong game which taught me how to build SVGs from scratch, and how to implement ES2015 classes.

# Setup

**Install dependencies:**

`> npm i`

**Run locally with Webpack Dev Server:**

`> npm start`

**Build for production:**

`> npm run build`

# Takeaways

Through 14 Challenges during the code along, I have a better understanding of ES2015 syntactical features, SVGs and Webpack to build a Pong Game. To provide a deeper understanding of the code, I believe three days would have been more beneficial. When it came to the stretch goals, I had a really hard time implementing something on my own. I successfully added in the winner, and two balls, but wish I had a better understanding of JavaScript to add more functions.
